## Review
### Data processing part for the plot
I like that you used citibike data. The data provides some interesting insight.

### Plot Evaluation- Clarity, Aesthetic, and Honesty
Your plot is clear. I can easily identify the tittle and gain insight from the plot. I like your descriptive labels and the size of the figure. 

However, I woul suggest being a bit more creative with the colors and customizing your plots a bit more.

Nice work!
