### GeoSpatial Analysis

For this assignment I worked with Vishwajeet. He helped me with concepts about using geopandas and coding.      
    

The citibike data was cleaned so i used the same data.    

Imported Seaborn later and not initially because of boxplots. They showed wrong output and outliers were not displayed. So I imported it after plotting the boxplots.

Time series gives the right graph on re executing the cell.
