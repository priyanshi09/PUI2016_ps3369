## Assignment1:

For Assignment1, I worked with vishwajeet and he helped me with the code. 

## Assignment2:

For Assignment2, I worked with Aaron, discussed concepts about DBScan and agglomerative clustering and implemented them.   I used the elbow method and the silhoette score to estimate the number of clusters( Since from both the methods number of clusters were 2, so i implemented using the same number of clusters only.)
