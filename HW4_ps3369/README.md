## Assignment 1

Prepared markdown file and have attached in the repository(HW4_ps3369)

forked Julian (jc7734), cloned and wrote the md file mentioning my feedback about citybikedata.

## Assignment 2

Worked with Achilles Saxby(aes807) on this assignment.

We Worked together on this and discussed the tests in detail understanding the concept and scope of every test. 

We then looked for papers on PLOS one and tried to figure out the independent variable and dependent variable, also control variables.

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved both MANCOVA and ANCOVA tests 

#### Here MANCOVA's were used first and ANCOVA's were used inside/follow up of the MANCOVA tests to determine/understand certain Interdependent qualities

### Part - II (Choosing one from the Second Half of the Table to use as a guideline)

#### Statistical Analysis done on a paper published that involved the Logistic Regression test. Here this uses archaeological data to relate the variable that is highly affected by the change in the Independent Variables.

## Assignment 3

1) used wget command to have the notebook in my compute. Studied about Z test and Chi-Square test on the links provided by instructor.

2) Aaron helped me to read the data and understand it. I framed the hypothesis and performed the Z test and chi-square test.

3) understood the signifinace of Z score and related it with the p value.


## Assignment 4
1) used wget command to have the notebook in my compute. studied about Ks test, pearson test, Spearman's test in detail and understood the scope of every test.

2)Related the p value with the significance level rejected the null hypothesis.



#### I helped Vishwajeet Shelar with interpretations( giving small suggestions) of the tests in assignment 4.
