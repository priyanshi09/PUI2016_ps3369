# Hi Julian
 I went through your hypothesis/ideas and tried to provide some feedback. 
 
## verify that their Null and alternative hypotheses are formulated correctly.
 
(1)Since the idea is not given, I would say the null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis is unclear to me. Also i would frame the idea before writing the hypothesis.

(2) In formulating the hypothesis under 35 is not clear, Could have been like "Trip duration under age 35"

(3)Also I think you have not stated the hypothesis correctly, since you can not compare subset of population with the total population.


## verify that the data supports the project: i.e. if the a data has the appropriate features (variables) to answer the question, and if the data was properly pre-processed to extract the needed values (there is some flexibility here since the test has not been chosen yet

(1) Assuming the hypothesis needed to calculate the age feature, which could have been done by using 2015 - birthyear. 

(2) The data has not been  completely processes, hence cannot be further evaluated.

(3) YOu did not declare a significance level alpha for testing your Null Hypothesis.

## Chose an appropriate test to test H0 given the type of data, and the question asked. You can refer to the flowchart of statistical tests for this in the slides, or to the CSU cheat-sheet here, of Statistics in a Nutshell.

Assuming that your hypothesis wanted to compare the two age groups and figuring out the differnces between two, I would use ANOVA to test your H0.
