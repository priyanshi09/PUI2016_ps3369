##  Assignment_1_Solutions:
I did the Assignment myself by understanding step by step concepts of linemodel fit and polynomial fit. Also Vishwajeet helped me with sorting values while plotting the polynomial fit.

I cleaned the data by removing NaN values and not needed columns.

I followed the further steps from scheleton notebook of the instructor.

I compared the likelihood ratio and was able to conclude the result about the best fit model i.e polynomial fit. 

for Extra credit i took help from  Yao's code and understood the concept.

# FBB feedback
good work on the analysis in place and tests appropriately chosen and performed.
please look at the comments on the Authorea article though. Mostly the issues are issues with the linguistics organization, and wording. I recommand you read a few articles, say 1/week, from science journals like PLOSOne to understand scientific writing a bit better.
