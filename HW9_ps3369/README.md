## Assignment 1


In this assignment I used NYC MTA datacube to detect the events, trends, and periodicity.      
Approaches:     
3-sigma outlier approach to calculate the threshold.     
Data smoothing  with Rolling mean and Rolling Standard devitaion.    
Periodicity analysis with Fourier transform and power analysis for frequencies


For this Assignment I worked in collaboration with Shalmali Kulkarni.
